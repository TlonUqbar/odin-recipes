# Odin Recipes

This project contains actual recipes, so if you are feeling adventurous and/or hungry you can try one of them. :)

The purpose of this project was to practice recently aqcuired HTML information, and the best way to crystalize that information into knowledge to create something. 

The project also required git commits a specific times so we can learn how to guage when to commit.
